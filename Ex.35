Write a program that reads a string from the keyboard and creates dictionary containing frequency of each character occurring in the string.
 
 def char_frequency(string):
     frequency = {}
     for char in string:
         if char in frequency:
             frequency[char] += 1
         else:
             frequency[char] = 1
     return frequency
 # Example usage
 if __name__ == "__main__":
     input_string = input("Enter a string: ")
     frequency_dict = char_frequency(input_string)
     print("Character frequency:", frequency_dict)
