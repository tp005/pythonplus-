# Write a Program that defines a function count_lower_upper() that accepts a string and calculates the number of lowercase and uppercase characters in the string. The function should return a dictionary with two keys: 'upper' and 'lower' and their corresponding values. The function should ignore any characters that are not alphabets. It should return these values as a dictionary. Call this function for some sample string
 
 def count_lower_upper(string):
     lower = 0
     upper = 0
     for char in string:
         if char.isalpha():
             if char.islower():
                 lower += 1
             else:
                 upper += 1
     return {'upper': upper, 'lower': lower}
 
 string = "Hello World! 123"
 result = count_lower_upper(string)
 print(result)
